# Basic-Image-Manipulation

# Project Description:

Basic image manipulation techniques form the foundation for various computer vision tasks, such as image recognition, and image segmentation. In this description, we will explore some of the fundamental image manipulation operations commonly used in computer vision.

The project will allow you to perform various image manipulations and transformations on input images. It includes functionalities such as resizing, rotating and flipping.

Here are the steps to implement the project:

1.Import the necessary libraries: OpenCV and NumPy.

2.Load the input image using OpenCV's imread() function.

3.Implement the image resizing functionality. You can choose to resize the image to specific dimensions or scale it by a factor.

4.Implement the image rotation functionality. You can specify the rotation angle in degrees.

5.Implement the image flipping functionality. You can choose to flip the image horizontally, vertically, or both.

6.Implement the image conversion to grayscale functionality.

7.Display the original image and the manipulated images using OpenCV's imshow() function.

That's it! This basic project will allow you to perform image manipulations and transformations on input images. You can expand upon this project by adding more functionalities or exploring advanced image processing techniques.
